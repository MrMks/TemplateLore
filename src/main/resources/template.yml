  # keys listed below will not be applied:
  # display, Damage, Count, id
  # the key should keep the format like: key|token
  #
  # if there isn't an token with the key, the parse will follow the rule below:
  # 1. if the value is a list, then test the first value. if the first value can be parsed to a long, then this will be a long array
  # 2. if the first value can't be parsed to a long, then this will be a list(nbt tag);
  # 3. if the value has sub-section, then this will be a compound;
  # 4. if the value can be parsed to a double, then it will be a double.
  # 5. if no rule was matched, this will be stored as string
  # this means it's ok to keep token empty, but it may occupy more memories than your data is required

  # there is no token for compound, just give it a sub-section

  # if the key|token is required to use as an exact key, use key||token, use key|||token to show key||token, and so on
  # if the token is n or the value is n|n, the value will be skip
  # only if the token is valid or the token is n, the last two '||' will be parsed to '|';
  # in other cases, the '||' won't be shrunk;

# <l:key> random select word and remember the word(after wrapped), will return the same word at next use
# <L:key> similar to the l but remember the not wrapped word
# <c:a,b> copy b times of a, for example, <c:|,0> will be "", <c:p,3> will be "ppp". notice that the ' ' at the beginning or the ending of the a will be trimmed. In this way, you can not repeat ' '
# <C:b> since the c can not repeat ' ', this will repeat b times of ' ';
